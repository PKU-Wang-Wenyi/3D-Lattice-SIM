# 3D-Lattice-SIM
This is the code repository for the article "Gentle live-cell super-resolution volumetric imaging with three-dimensional lattice structured illumination microscopy".
Currently, the package contains the .m source code and a .exe files containing GUI of the 3D-Lattice-SIM reconstruction code
💻 System requirements
The analytical reconstruction software is implemented with MATALB 2025a and tested in Windows 10&11 environments.
To run .exe files ，matlab runtime R2025a (25.1) is necessary, which is aviliable in https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
