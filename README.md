# 3D-Lattice-SIM

This is the code repository for the article **"Gentle live-cell super-resolution volumetric imaging with three-dimensional lattice structured illumination microscopy"**.

Currently, the package contains:
- `.m` source code
- `.exe` files containing GUI of the 3D-Lattice-SIM reconstruction code
- We have also developed a reconstruction scheme tailored for orthogonal lattice 3D-SIM data acquired with the ZEISS Elyra 7 system.
## 💻 System Requirements

The analytical reconstruction software is implemented with MATLAB 2025a and tested in Windows 10 & 11 environments.

## Runtime Requirements
To run `.exe` files, **MATLAB Runtime R2025a (25.1)** is necessary.
